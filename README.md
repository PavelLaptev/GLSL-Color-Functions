# GLSL-Color-Functions

![LCh color space sRGB gamut](screenshot2.png?raw=true "sRGB Gamut in LCh Color Space")

Color space conversions, metrics, and other utility functions for color in GLSL.

Still very much a work-in-progress! If you see anything wrong, please let me know (or make a new branch if you're feeling nice).

## Currently Included:
Color Spaces:
* XYZ
* sRGB
* RGB
* L\*a\*b\* (CIELAB)
* LCh (CIELCh)
* P3 Display
* sYCC (sRGB's official YCbCr space)

Other:
* A (proper) implementation of CIE Delta-E 2000
* Color from temperature (cubic approximation) and temperature from color (McCamy approximation)
* Lightness / Luminance / Luma functions
* D65/D50 white point option for RGB<->XYZ and L\*a\*b\*<->XYZ

## Planned (descending priority):
* HSL/HSV
* Chroma/Hue getter functions
* Delta E CMC
* [Oklab](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/)
* Color temperature adjustment
* Interpolation wrapper functions
* CIELUV
* Gamut mapping?
